Description: In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher - Y

2. Completed all Levels:
  Level 1 : yes
  level 2 : yes
  Level 3 : yes
  Level 4 : yes
  Level 5 : yes

3. Used Catmull-Rom Splines to render the Track - yes

4. Rendered a Rail Cross Section - yes

5. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation - yes

6. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) - yes 

7. Understandably written, well commented code - yes

8. Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots -yes

Extra Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Render a T-shaped rail cross section - N

2. Render a Double Rail - Y

3. Made the track circular and closed it with C1 continuity - N

4. Added OpenGl lighting - N

5. Any Additional Scene Elements? (list them here) - N

6. Generate track from several sequences of splines - N
